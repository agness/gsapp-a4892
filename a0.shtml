            First, choose one aspect of your daily life on which to collect personal data for the next 7 days. This can be as simple as “Brushed teeth: yes/no” or as complex as “Wake up mood: feeling daunted by to-do list, like I need a egg-and-cheese croissant kind of morning.”
            </p><p>
            In any case, make sure you will have 7 data points by the end of the week. Using only a black sharpie, a letter-size sheet of white paper, draw a simple visual representation of your data.
            </p><p>
            Now write a set of instructions, in English, step-by-step, such that a classmate will be able to recreate your visualization in under 3min. without having ever seen your original drawing. Bring your instructions to class.
