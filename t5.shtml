                  Using the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Energy-and-Water-Data-Disclosure-for-Local-Law-84-/8u86-bviy">NYC 2016 Water and Energy</a> data set as an example, where we want to visualize total water consumption per borough, here we'll walk you through some common data restructuring tactics. (Note: you're no longer allowed to use this set of dimensions from this data set for your assignment. Please find your own dataset!)

                  The Visualization tool on NYC Open Data allows you to quickly check what values to expect. For example, here I see ~4000 rows with "Not Available" value.

                  However, I can also see that this count roughly correlates with the number of rows where "Water Required?" is "No", and cross-checked with the data definitions PDF, this makes sense for us to ignore since we're not interested in understanding "buildings" that don't need water (e.g. a parking lot.)

                  I'm not sure why it's missing, but there's very few rows with this problem so I don't expect it to impact the final total H2O consumption numbers. I deleted these empty rows also.

                  Next example restructuring is with Property Type values: there's way too many of them to be interesting in a visualization. Let's rename them so that things like "K-12 School" and "College/University" both count as "Educational", and "Hospital" as well as "Medical Office" both count as "Medical". To see all the individual values in that column, you can construct a pivot table with unique values, like so.

                  Next, I copied the values over to a new sheet, and manually entered the new values I wanted to convert to. Here we've basically constructed a lookup table.

                  Now go back to the original sheet and create a new column to hold converted property values based on the lookup sheet. Enter the lookup formula. Now you need to copy the formula all the way down all 7000+ rows in the sheet.

                  You'll see the result is perhaps not quite what you expect. In any case I'm interested in boroughs as the higher level grouping. You can change this by simply reordering the rows boxes on the right.

                  If everything is working correctly, you'll see your terminal output reflect all the HTTP requests your browser is sending to your local server to fetch your page. Now you can load any p5.js sketches with the same url scheme, for example <i><a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000/</a>A1/index.html</i>.

                  Finally, before exporting to CSV for your p5.js sketch, make sure any number values you have are in plain vanilla formatting. Otherwise, pretty values like "$1,234,567.89" will be read as strings by Javascript and then you'll have to parse out the punctuation. Easier to reformat in Google Sheets before you export.
