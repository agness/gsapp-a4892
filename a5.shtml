                <p>This is a design assignment. You are the data and visualization critic.</p>
                <p>Choose a dataset that is related to an issue you care about. Design a visualization that is misleading while being a technically accurate representation of your chosen data set. You must use a real data set, and your misrepresentation <b>should not be immediately obvious.</b> Challenge yourself to depict a "misleading" story is just as clear and believable, if not more so, than the more accurate (if murky) story in the data; alternatively, explore what forms and aesthetics are possible with visual illusions.</p><p>
                Write a few paragraphs (250~400 words; hint: your design should be sufficiently complex) to explain your approach. If it helps make your design intention clear, include a correct representation; if it helps you generate ideas, consider datasets on controversial topics with divergent public opinion.</p><p>
                You may not choose from these common mistakes (find something more interesting!)<ul>
                    <li>zeroing Y-axis</li>
                    <li>pie charts with too many labels</li>
                    <li>3D bar charts</li>
                    <li>obviously unrelated dimensions</li>
                    </ul>
                Create a digital version of your visualization and accompanying text, and post it on your GitHub homepage. (PNG, PDF, HTML, MOV is all fine.)</p>
