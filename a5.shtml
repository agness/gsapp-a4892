                    <h2>Part 1: Generative form</h2>
                    <p>
                    Generative form refers to visual aesthetics that are generated from algorithms, built up via relatively simple rules, to mimic complex systems found in nature, whether physics of a ball bouncing the wall, birds flying in a flock pattern, or how water molecules flow through bottlenecks. Or it can be as simple as working with fractals.
                    </p><p>
                    Look under P5 Examples for the <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">Simulate</a> section. Play with these examples; try to change different parameters in them and see what happens. Then, choose one, copy it and modify it to somehow communicate the current time with hour and minutes. (Note: it does <b>not</b> have to be a clock and continue to display time.)</p><p>Your choice of mapping does not need to be immediately obvious but it should not be simplistic (e.g. don't map hour to color); your viewer need not be able to "read" the exact minutes but should be able to guess within a quarter hour. Be creative, have fun!</p>
                    <p>Link to your sketch on GitHub.</p>

                    <h2>Part 2: Final project idea paragraphs</h2>
                    <p>
                    Start thinking about your final project: in the final four-week assignment, you will be following your own data adventure. (You will continue to work individually.)
                    </p>
                    <p>For this week's assignment, write <b>three paragraphs</b> proposing different final directions. Your final should be larger in scope and complexity than the <a href="a4.shtml">A4 Geography</a> assignment. It should be something you're passionate about and interested in learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Some possible starting places:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Personal: some type of personal data that you’ve collected</li>
                    <li>Research/class: information design questions around your research, other classes, or thesis</li>
                    <li>Explanation: a complex idea that’s data-centric, and making it easily understandable</li>
                    <li>Any open datasets, such as those mentioned in class <a href="a4.shtml">here</a> or <a href="t4.shtml">here</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Make sure each of your idea paragraphs includes at minimum:
                    <ul>
                    <li>What story you want to tell
                    <li>The relevant topics in data viz that you're excited to focus on (e.g. visual design, code, interactivity, bias, etc.)</li>
                    <li>A link to a data source (even if the data needs work)</li>
                    <li>Reference to a prior work that inspires this idea (whether because of story, form, interaction, data, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p><p>
                    Submit your three paragraphs through <a href="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/57696/assignments/158327">Canvas</a>.</p>
